# Guitar Tabs Player

## Description of Project Structure

This application will take in **guitar notes**
and play them by turning them into guitar sounds of those notes.
People who want to listen to what a guitar song sounds
like without playing it, and I will use it. This project
is of interest to me because I enjoy playing guitar,
and I think creating this application will make it *easier*
to create and listen to songs for guitar.
